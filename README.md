Badeen Display is a retro typeface that takes a bold dive into the vibrant world of youth and Arab pop culture. It challenges the norms of Arabic typography with its unique blend of contrasts, featuring a daring mix of thick and thin strokes paired with both soft and hard edges. This creates a typeface with a strong, youthful character.
